    <h2>What is this page?</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this page is to provide an environment for English learners
      to test their knowledge on irregular verbs. The application has been available
      for everyone on the Internet so that anyone can access this tool whenever they
      need it, no matter the institution they belong to (or if they are self-taught!)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      First, you will be asked how many different verbs will be displayed in the table
      for you to fill out their respective forms. When you press the <button class="dummy">Generate</button>
      button, a list with as many (randomly chosen) verbs as you wanted will appear, showing only
      one of their forms. The goal is to fill out the rest with as many few errors as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you feel like you're ready to check your results, press the <button class="dummy">Submit</button>
      at the bottom of the page and you will be given a score and the correct forms will be
      displayed on the table (on green if they were correct, and on red if they were not).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can regenerate the list again with new verbs whenever you want to by clicking the
      <button class="dummy">Regenerate</button> button (and changing the number of verbs if you wish to do so).
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Feedback, suggestions, contact and bug report</h2>
    <p>
